  "markdown": "Based on my own experiences and those of my customers, the answer for me is very clear: yes, they are! A workshop is so much more than a team call, a telco, or back-and-forth-emails could ever accomplish. \n\nFor me, a workshop means allowing all the brilliant minds of the teams, and the workshop members to be part of the process, letting their brains work, and bringing their diverse expertise and all they are with them. It is an invitation to let ideas flow: Away from the desk, the laptop, the usual working environment – preferably outside the office.  \n\nAnd yes, there are a few keys to making it fun and successful. \n\nIt’s about  \n\n* the energy, the spirit, the thoughts, the good and the bad \n* out-of-the-box thinking, stepping out, taking and allowing different perspectives \\\n  (As always there’s not only white or black, yellow or green, right or wrong – there is a whole range of ideas, possibilities and solutions.) \n* FOCUS, SPIRIT & INTENTION \n\nKeys to great workshops – to make a real difference \n\n* the clear focus on the goal – the desired overall outcome = THE BIG PICTURE   \n* the preparation – before and after \\\n  (It takes a great workshop storyboard based on the goal, topic, and content, using the most appropriate methods and timetable to facilitate with joy, energy, and openness.) \n* the focus while being flexible to adapt to the latest information given = intuitive change while walking \n* the interaction and the space to let it flow \n* and not to forget – the follow-up to make the next steps happen",
