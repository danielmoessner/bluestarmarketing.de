  "text": "My journey with Blue Star Marketing: Since my responsibilities and tasks exceeded my available time frame in 2019 already, and still do today due to increasing travel activities, I was looking for a solution to bring our channel marketing on a sustainable path of growth while profiting from a learning curve. With Silke, I have found someone who, with her wealth of ideas, enthusiasm and extremely quick wits and skills, takes projects off my hands in their entirety. No matter if she takes over the lead on a certain job or if she designs and implements a concept: The work is always characterized by profound, up-to-date marketing know-how in our market environment. This makes me feel very well and individually advised, and I am easily convinced to explore new ways. The results are impressive and of exceptional quality. With Silke, I was able to take the results of my tasks to a new level and to grow. Simply put: fast, structured, reliable, enthusiastic and inspiring â€“ this is what makes the collaboration with Silke fun!",
